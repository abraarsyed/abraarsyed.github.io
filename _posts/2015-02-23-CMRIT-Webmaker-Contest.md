#Teach the WEB!!!

###How it all started

We had a Student council meeting immediately after the last exam of the fifth semester on december 31,2014. That was the day when it all started. We had to plan out everything for our forth coming annual college fest - [CULTURA'15](http://www.cultura15.com) and hence the meeting. I saw this as an oppurtunity to do something as a FSA. I decided to conduct a web design contest for Cultura'15 but this contest had a twist.

Unlike the other web designing contest, wherein only the experienced web makers get to participate,this contest was designed for anyone and everyone. It was possible this way with the help of Mozilla Webmaker tools which intends on making the web users - **The creators and makers of web**.

Initially I approached [Galaxy Kadiyala](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/galaxyk/) with this idea. Usually Webmaker Parties are not conducted as Contest, so I felt it might not be accepted but to my surprise I got a very supportive response from him. He also looped in a lot of people who helped me out to plan and execute the event successfully.

Special thanks to [Priyanka Nag](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/priynag/) for guiding me during the important decision making process and also helping me get the budget request accepted for the event.

Also I would like to thank Our judges for the event - [Abhiram Ravikumar](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/abhi12ravi/)

A lot of discussions,plannings and set-up arrangements took place for the next 2 months and it was during this time that I attended the FSA bootcamp which added on to my ability to plan and organise things better.

###The Webmaker Contest

It was an Inter-college event with 45+ number of participants.
Since we wanted everyone to participate and compete,irrespective of their coding skills, we started the event by taking session on the webmaker tools. The session was taken by the judges itself. We could see a lot of excitement among the students.

After the session, the participants were taken to two labs and then the contest began. We had two theme based rounds in the contest. The participants were free to use any or all webmaker tools for both the rounds. 

The first round had the following theme : 

> ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 or Your favorite TV Show. 

The second round had the following theme : 

> ISRO's Mars Orbiter Mission.

Despite testing the labs, we faced a small problem with the bandwidth but nevertheless the participants were already ignited enough to win the contest and it was definitely not an easy task to judge such an event.

Finally we had one winner of the contest-Tanmoy Paul and a lot of other participants taking back lot of cool swags.

I felt this was one of the best events that I had organised till date. It was not just about winning the contest, we assured everyone became a Webmaker which itself was a **win-win** situation for everyone. Also this persuaded the **CMRTIANS** to become **MOZILLIANS** and we have a very good number of FSAs in our college now. Also, We are starting a Mozilla club which will be called **MOZIETY** (MOZILLA + ANXIETY).
Last but not the least, 

YES , and thats how I finally got my first Mozilla T-shirt.
